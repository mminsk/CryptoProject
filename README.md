# CryptoProject

Notes:
When users register, a new RSA private and public key is generated. The public key is stored in their JSON file that also contains their username and password. Their private key is stored in a new local file. Since there is not code to register new users, this is done manually.

When a new conversation is created, a local file is created with the conversation counters.
